Ingredients:
(4 tablespoon) yeast
(1 teaspoon) sugar
(.25 cup) vegetable oil
(1 teaspoon) salt
(3.5 cup) flour
(.5 pound) ground beef
(1) onions
(2 cup) tomato sauce
(1 tablespoon) oregano
(1 teaspoon) basil
(1) bell peppers
(2 cup) mozzarella
Directions:
1. In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, a cup at a time, to form soft dough. Turn onto floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, brown beef and onion; drain. Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese. Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
