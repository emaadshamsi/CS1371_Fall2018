% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parentheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT, like so:
%   Ex. GT = 1 + 1;


% Graph Theory relates to the analysis and searching of a graph (a
% collection of nodes connected by edges). Breadth-First Search and
% Depth-First Search are two algorithms that can be used to find a path
% between a starting node and a desired ending node in a graph.

% Directions: For each question, select the number corresponding to the
% best answer.

% Options:
%
% 1 - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
% 2 - Depth-First Search (DFS)
% 3 - Stack
% 4 - Queue
% 5 - FIFO (First In First Out)
% 6 - LIFO (Last In First Out)
% 7 - none of the above

% 1. Which sorting algorithm guarantees the shortest path to the target
% node? (A)
A = 1;

% 2. Which sorting algorithm guarantees the fastest time to find the target
% node? (B)
B = 7;

% 3. Which data structure is used in the DFS algorithm? (C)
C = 3;

% 4. Which data structure is used in the BFS algorithm? (D)
D = 4;

% 5. What beahvior does a stack follow? (E)
E = 6;

% 6. What behavior does a queue follow? (F)
F = 5;
