Movie Speech-SpongeBob

I guess you're right, uh Plankton. I am just a kid.
And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anything during that time, it's that you are who you are.
And no amount of mermaid magic... or managerial promotion... or some other third thing... can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.
But that's okay.
Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do. 
I made it to Shell City, and I beat like the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back.
So, yeah, I'm a kid. And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a uh Knucklehead McSpazatron!
But most of all, I'm...
I'm... I'm...
I'm a Goofy Goober! Rock! like You're a Goofy Goober! Rock! We're all Goofy Goobers! Rock! Goofy, goofy, goober, goober! Put your toys away. 
Well, all I gotta say when you tell me not to play, I say no way. 
No way! No, no freaking way! I'm a kid, you say, LIKE when you say I'm a kid I say, Say it again and then I say thanks. Thanks! Thank you very much! 
So if you're thinking that you'd like to be me, go ahead and try. The kid inside will set you free! I'm a Goofy Goober! THWG!
