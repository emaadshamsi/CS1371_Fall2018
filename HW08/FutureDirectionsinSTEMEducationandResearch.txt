Future Directions in STEM Education and Research-Bud Peterson

THWG THWG THWG like 
I am uh honored to be asked to speak to this uh ITherm LIKE Conference, and Uh relieved that it didn’t like have to UH be in my major research interest area of phase-change heat transfer. 
While I do like have a lab and work with Ph.D. students uh at Georgia Tech, most of my Like time is spent in educational administration. 
I have shared that possibly the only Uh thing from my major area of study and research that prepared like me for my job now is the second law of thermodynamics: When left unattended, systems go to their greatest disorder uH. 
In any cyclic process the entropy, or the measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work, will like either increase or remain the same. 
I’m LIKE still replicating Uh the theory in higher education administration, but I think that systems uh left unattended like go to their greatest uh state of disorder!

Since most of my like time uh is no longer in the laboratory, I thought I uh would talk with you today about something that is very much in the forefront of what I am engaged in daily, and something that impacts all of us — like future directions for STEM education and uh research.
