% Instructions:
%   1) Follow the directions for each problem very carefully or you will
%   lose points.
%   2) Make sure you name functions exactly as described in the problems or
%   you will not receive credit.
%   3) Read the announcements! Any clarifications and/or updates will be
%   announced on Canvas. Check the Canvas announcements at least once
%   a day.
%   4) You should not use any of the following functions in any file that 
%   you submit to Canvas:
%       a) clear
%       b) clc
%       c) solve
%       d) input
%       e) disp
%       f) close all

%% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included in this homework for practice is an m-file
% called "ABCs_functions.m". Open this file in MATLAB and 
% complete it according to the directions contained within.
% You can check your answers against the solution provided. These problems 
% will not be turned in for credit.
%
% Files to Complete: 
%	ABCs_functions.m

%

%==========================================================================
%% PART 2. Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW01_DrillProblems.pdf",
% containing instructions for 4 drill problems that cover the
% following topic:
%
%	Basics
%
% Follow the directions carefully to write code to complete the drill
% problems as described. Make sure file names as well as function headers
% are written exactly as described in the problem text. If your function
% headers are not written as specified, you will recieve an automatic
% zero for that problem.
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case.
%
%% Function Name: pythag
%
% Test Cases:
% [c1] = pythag(3, 4)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [c2] = pythag(5, 5)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [c3] = pythag(16, 25)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: trig
%
% Test Cases:
%[out1, out2] = trig(45, 15)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [out1, out2] = trig(10, 20)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [out1, out2] = trig(25, 35)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: herons
%
% Test Cases:
% [area1] = herons(2, 2, 4)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [area2] = herons(5, 12, 13)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [area3] = herons(71, 62, 12)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: extAngles
%
% Test Cases:
% [sides1] = extAngles(60)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [sides2] = extAngles(90)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
% 
% [sides3] = extAngles(120)
% Output variables should be identical to those produced by the solution file
